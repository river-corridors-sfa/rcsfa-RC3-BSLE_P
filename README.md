## Summary
This data package is associated with the publication “Burn severity and vegetation type control phosphorus concentration, molecular composition, and mobilization” submitted to Environmental Science & Technology (Barnes et al. 2024).

This study investigates how phosphorus (P) biogeochemistry is altered by burn severity in contrasting types of vegetation chars. This data package documents the workflow used to process and generate the main figures and statistics in the manuscript. The R scripts reference minimally processed P nuclear magnetic resonance (P-NMR) and X-ray absorption near edge structure (P-XANES) data, as well as fully processed data including total elemental composition of the solid chars, total elemental composition of the char leachates (particulate and aqueous phases), and leachate aqueous phase molybdate reactive P concentration. These source data and associated metadata can be found in another data package, available on ESS-DIVE at https://data.ess-dive.lbl.gov/datasets/doi:10.15485/1894135 (Grieger et al. 2022; v3). Scripts included in this data package finish the processing workflow for NMR and XANES data. These data can be used to gain a better understanding of bulk chemical changes in chars and their leachates, as well as detailed molecular changes to P.
